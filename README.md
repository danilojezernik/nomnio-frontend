# Frontend task for NOMNIO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3. I decided to make backend to hide API key. It is a good practice that i have learned the hard way from my mentor and that is NEWER REVEAL YOUR API KEY TO PUBLIC.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production server

Run `npm run prod` for a prod server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Data will be sent from `https://nomnio-api-0cacfbde4021.herokuapp.com/<endpoint-name>`. Use endpoint name: `weather-forecast` or `weather-current`; to see data received from API.
